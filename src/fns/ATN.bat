:: ATN Function
:: Purpose:
:: To return the arctangent of x, when x is expressed in radians.
:: 
:: Syntax:
:: ATN(x)
:: Comments:
:: The result is within the range of -π/2 to π/2.
::
:: The expression x may be any numeric type. The evaluation of ATN is performed in single precision unless the /d switch is used when GW-BASIC is executed.
::
:: To convert from degrees to radians, multiply by π/180.
::
:: Examples:
:: 10 INPUT X
:: 20 PRINT ATN(X)
:: RUN
:: ? 3
:: 1.249046
::Prints the arctangent of 3 radians (1.249046).
